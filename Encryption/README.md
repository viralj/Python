Encryption
==========

This is very simple and small encryption/decryption program that asks user whether to encrypt 
string or decrypt the list.

The encryption class takes a sting and converts into ASCII characters as a list and then
with mathematical formula, it does some addition, multiplication, division and subtraction 
to encrypt the string.

The decryption class asks user to enter list of encrypted string and by using reverse math
formula of encryption method and decrypt the list. And this decrepted list, will be converted
back to string from ASCII characters.

This is very simple and small Encryption/Decryption function.
